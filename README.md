Data Preparation

Normalize the Data:

The dataset is normalized using StandardScaler() from scikit-learn to ensure all features have the same scale.

A new DataFrame is created with the scaled data, maintaining coin_id as the index.

Preview the Data:

The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should display the normalized values.

Finding the Optimal k Using the Elbow Method

Generate a list of k-values ranging from 1 to 11.

Compute the inertia for each k-value using a for loop.

Store the inertia values in a list.

Plot an Elbow Curve to visualize the optimal k-value.

Identify the best k-value from the plot and document the selection.

Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-Means

Train the K-Means Model:

Initialize the model using the best k-value.

Fit the model on the scaled data.

Predict cluster labels for each cryptocurrency.

Visualization:

Create a scatter plot using hvPlot.

Set x-axis as price_change_percentage_24h and y-axis as price_change_percentage_7d.

Color the points based on cluster labels.

Add coin_id as a hover feature.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduce the datasetâ€™s dimensionality to three principal components.

Retrieve the explained variance for each principal component.

Compute the total explained variance and analyze the retained information.

Create a new PCA-transformed DataFrame, keeping coin_id as the index.

Finding the Optimal k Using PCA Data

Repeat the Elbow Method using the PCA-transformed data.

Compare the best k-value obtained with the original dataset.

Answer: Does reducing features impact the clustering?

Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using PCA Data

Train the K-Means Model:

Use the best k-value found for PCA data.

Fit the model on the PCA-transformed dataset.

Predict clusters and add them to the DataFrame.

Visualization:

Create a scatter plot using hvPlot.

Set x-axis as PC1 and y-axis as PC2.

Color points based on cluster labels.

Include coin_id as a hover feature.

Key Insights & Conclusion

The optimal k-value might differ between the original and PCA-transformed data.

Using PCA reduces computational complexity while still retaining essential variance.

Clustering helps identify cryptocurrency market trends and potential investment strategies.
